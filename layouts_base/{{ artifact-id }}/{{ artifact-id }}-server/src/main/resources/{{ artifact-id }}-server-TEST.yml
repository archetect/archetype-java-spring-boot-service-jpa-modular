# This configuration is used when running under a TEST RuntimeEnvironment. It is additive to the baseline configuration
# file, and provides overrides necessary for running unit/integration tests.
#
# Typically, the TEST RuntimeEnvironment is determined automatically by the presence of common testing annotations being
# present on the classpath. A TEST RuntimeEnvironment can also be set explicitly by specifying ENV=test as a
#  System Property (-DENV=test).
